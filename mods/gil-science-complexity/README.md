This is a mod that adds new challenges and complexity to Space Age's new science packs and their transportation.

## Features

### Nauvis tweaks
- Space science packs now require a small amount of uranium-235.

### Vulcanus tweaks
- Metallurgic science packs weigh more and have smaller stack sizes

### Fulgora tweaks
- Electromagnetic science packs must be taken to space and "charged" before use in labs

### Gleba tweaks
- Agricultural science packs requires 20 nutrients in addition to their other ingredients (similar to how it was in the beta)

### Aquilo tweaks
- Cryogenic science packs require cooling to avoid spoiling into warm cryogenic packs
- Fully spoiled packs require a costlier recipe for cooling
